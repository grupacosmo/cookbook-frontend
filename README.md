Project for educational purposes.

## Tasks

All tasks are added to code as comments with `todo(first_name.last_name)` phrase. If you are using webstorm, you can
find all todo comments in the left lower corner.

## Project structure

In all directories (assets, components etc.) you can find README files with description.

## Routing and paths

If you are looking for url for your page, you can find it in `index.js` file.

## Assumptions

- This project uses [AntD](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) framework, so use antd components if you can ;) No
  need to create everything from scratch.
- Feel free to design your pages as you wish, however it needs to be responsive
  (use [antd grid system](https://ant.design/components/grid/)).
- You can use this color palette:
